       Sea turtles are know to make long migrations between their feeding and breeding areas. Leatherbacks are known to travel an average of nealry 4000km each way.
       After mating in the sea. the females come ashore to lay their egss in the coastal area.
       They dig a hole in the sand, deposit the eggs cover it back up and return to the sea. 

       It takes around 60 days for the egss to hatch and thr baby sea turtles make their way to the sea at night where they often face dangers such as sea birds and crabs.
