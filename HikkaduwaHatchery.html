        The Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery is situated a few kilometers away, north of the hikkaduwa town. 
        The centres main goals are to conserve the dwindling endangered species of turtles in the world. 
        In its beginning, it started off as a community project to conserve and protect the biodiversity of the southern coast and is one of the many hatcheries in the coastal area,
        and now it is a fully fledged hatchery and rescue centre with a dedicated team that study, care and protect several turtle species.
       Some of the protected turtle varieties are Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtles.

        Some of these turtles are in different sizes as they need to grow to be released back into their  natural habitats.
         Visitors may also encounter some tutrles with mutilated body parts due to getting caught in boat engines. 
         It will take trutles a considerable amount of tike to recover their balance as prior to the accident. 
         The farm takes care of such disabled turtles and helps them to sustain their lives in the future.
        Tourisits can read about turtles and find information and photographs of the tutrls set up around the tanks.
         A guide will also be able to explain how the trutels are rescued and the egg hatching process.

          <img src="images/hatch.jpg" class="img3" alt="Releasing Turtles">
        <p class="P3">
            You can stop by this enclosure between the months of January and April to see whether any turtle eggs are hatching. 
            Around 6:30 p.m. each night, the turtles are turned loose from their pen and allowed to scurry for the water.
            When strolling along the main beach, you can stop by the hatchery at any time, albeit there might not be any turtles there.
             Keep watching throughout the day because you'll be able to tell when they hatch that they are set to be freed.            
            Anyone can join this space for free since it is public. Even some visitors were allowed to assist in moving the young turtles from the hatchery to the beach.
